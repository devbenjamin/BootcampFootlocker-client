## Why Bootcamp Footlocker
Bootcamp Footlocker (BF) was created to introduce students at Eleven Fifty Academy (EFA), and all developers, to some extremely helpful resources we have found and successfully used in our intellectual journey through the JavaScript SmartStart accelerated frontend course. Students can ask for, and receive, help from other users on topic-specific resource pages via the message boards found on these pages. Additionally, as students learn how to learn, BF can be used to store students' own found resources.

It is our hope that, through this app, we can smooth the road for future students and help raise the bar even higher for EFA graduates.
